                <li>
                    In 'The Intruder', the Members go against the Intruder(s).
                </li>
                <li>
                    First of all, the Idol will be chosen. The Idol can be Automatic or Custom. With the Custom Idol feature enabled, one of the players will occupy this role.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Idol will chose a Keyword which will be known by every Member, but not by the Intruders. She/He will also give each Intruder a Hint word, so they can more easily survive the first round.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The device will be passed from player to player, assigning each one their role and giving: to Members the Keyword, and to Intruders their respective Hint word.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After that, we will proceed to a Round of Words: one by one, each player will say a word out loud. Members will have to say a word that is related to the Keyword to show that they are indeed Members. Intruders can say the Hint word they've been given.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The goal of the Intruders is to figure out what the Keyword is through the words they heard the other players say.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the Round of Words is over, the game proceeds to an Elimination Round.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All players will debate on who they think the Intruder(s) is according to the words that were said out loud. After the debate there will be a vote. Each player will vote for who they suspect is an Intruder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the Elimination Round is over, someone will have been vanished and we will know if we have a winner or not.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If all the Intruders have been eliminated, the Members will have won. If the Intruders occupy a certain percentage of the total players, the Intruders will have won.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If after the vote there is no winner, a new Round of Words will proceed, followed by an Elimination Round, and so on, until a winner is established.

                    If after the initial vote there are 2 or more people with the same number of votes, a ballot will be held between them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If in this ballot there are 2 nominees: the voters will be all except the 2 nominees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the other hand, if in this ballot there are 3 or more nominees: everyone will vote, including the nominees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It may happen that there is more than one ballot. For example: in the initial voting there are 4 nominees, it goes to a first ballot in which 2 of those 4 players are left with the same number of votes, in this case it will go to a second ballot between those 2 players.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For this second ballot and for all subsequent ballot, the rule is that only those who were never nominated (in the concurrent elimination round) will vote, that is, the current nominees will not vote, nor will those who were initially nominated and were saved in the previous ballot.
